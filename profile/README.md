Founded by IlMelons and Rico in 2025.
We are a team of developers dedicated to creating scripts for FiveM, guided by four core principles:
- **Simplicity:** we design intuitive and easy-to-implement scripts, accessible to both newcomers and experienced developers, without superfluous dependencies or unnecessary complexity.
- **Constant Updates:** we keep all our projects aligned with the latest standards, ensuring that those who use them always have the best experience possible.
- **Completeness:** the ultimate goal of every project is completeness and optimal functionality, delivering polished and ready-to-use solutions.
- **Authenticity:** we operate with integrity and transparency. We only partner with creators whose products we use and believe in, never in exchange for money. Our reputation and appreciation must be earned, not bought.
